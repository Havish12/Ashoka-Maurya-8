        <h2 id="title">What is the career of Ashoka?</h2>
        <p id="text1">Ashoka was the emperor of India, owning all most 90% of the land. Ashoka is mainly known for his rock edicts (the pillars and the caves). Ashoka is remembered for being a modest ruler, being fair, controlling a big empire with respect, integrity and dharma.(Dharma is a teaching from the Buddhist monks). Of course, this was after he stopped being greedy and bloodthirsty. Before he became a Buddhist follower, he was feared throughout India because what he has done. Ashoka wanted everything to be first class. Meaning that if he wanted something, he wanted the best possible version of that certain thing. If people did not obey his orders, they would either be killed immediatly, or tortured in a prison called Ashoka's Hell. On the outside of this torture room, were jewels and all fancy luxuries to disguise it. This was because they wanted to keep the torture room a secret. This was because Ashoka and some of his ministers thought that if the torture room was out in the open, then the person/s being tortured, might have someone that would help them escape. Since Ashoka was the emperor and no one dared to steal from him because of the consequences, Ashoka decided to make it look like a luxury building. </p>
